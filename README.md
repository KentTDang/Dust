### Inspiration
Finding a way to donate to a charity can be hard, but finding a charity you can trust is even harder. Many Americans argue that they “cannot determine a charity’s credibility” and feel “unorganized in their approach to charitable giving” (Fidelity Charitable, 2017). We realized that many people need a quick way to find a trustworthy charity and an easy way to donate. To tackle this issue, we thought, “What better way than to seamlessly integrate donations into your everyday life with a touch of AI?”

### What It Does
Dust is an app that helps you round up your recent purchases and donate the extra change to a wide range of charities! This way, you can make your everyday purchases while knowing you’re making a difference in the world with every transaction.
To find a charity, we use artificial intelligence and search tools to help you discover the perfect match for your cause.
To participate, all you need to do is create an account, add a credit card that you use every day, and start making purchases. Dust takes care of the rest! Our app pulls your recent credit card transactions from your bank and rounds the purchase price up to the nearest dollar. After each transaction, we automatically sum up that “extra change” and donate it to your selected charities.
