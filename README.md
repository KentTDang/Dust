### Inspiration
One of the greatest challenges in education today is the shortage of teachers equipped to support deaf students. Communication barriers hinder their ability to engage fully with lessons, making it difficult to grasp key concepts and keep up with their peers. As a result, these students often face misunderstandings that slow their academic progress. With the rise of online learning, access to effective educational tools has become even more critical.

### What It Does
LiveHands is a speech-to-ASL Chrome extension that bridges the communication gap by delivering real-time translation, empowering deaf students to excel academically. Whether you're watching a video or attending a live meeting, LiveHands provides seamless translation on the spot. Equipped with an LLM (Large Language Model), it can also expand on topics, answer questions, and generate organized notes based on lectures or videos.
